# EXPLANATION

This plugin works by changing the drop of a certain block, the blocks can be edited by the config.yml. You can add any block and any drop for that block, it can also be randomized!


# PERMISSIONS

there is only 1 permission.

randomblock.reload | With this permission players can reload the config.yml file. So no need to /rl your server.



# COMMANDS

/blockdrop reload OR /blockdrop rl | Reloads the config.yml


# ITEM AMOUNT

You can customize the amount that the blocks give. There is a set value: drop-amount, this will drop every time. and there is a Max-drop-amount and a Min-drop-amount. You can set a Maximum and a Minium, It will randomly choose between the 2 numbers, for this to work, drop-amount, needs to be set to FALSE
